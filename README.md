# Project Euler

This repository was created to share my solved euler math problems that aims to learn golang and have fun in the same time. All of the [problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives) comes from the Euler website and follow the correct sequency of the problems to avoit cheat.

I already solved some exercises using python and javascript focused in improve my skills in these awesome languages. It isn't different now but what a fuck I would like `golang` now? that's a curious question. Seem like `golang` it's a hipster language famous by your memory manager and because just go fast enought. So, said that I would like to learn this one to create some ETL++ projects to give a change for the language. :star:
